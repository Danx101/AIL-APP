# Comprehensive Plan: German Leads Tab Improvements

## Summary
Transform the leads management tab from "Leads Listen" to "Leads" with German translations, improved kanban functionality, and new history view capabilities.

## Current State Analysis
- **Current tab name**: "Lead Listen" (line 8041 in app.js)
- **Current search bar**: Located above kanban (lines 162-173 in LeadKanban.js)
- **Current archive**: "Archive History" with toggle visibility
- **Current behavior**: Leads added to top of columns, can be dropped in same column
- **Issue identified**: Sidebar occasionally disappears when in lead tab

## Phase 1: Basic Updates (Frontend Navigation & Labels)
1. **Update sidebar navigation text** in `app.js:8041` from "Lead Listen" to "Leads"
2. **Remove search bar** above kanban in `LeadKanban.js:162-173`
3. **German translations for main kanban interface**:
   - Column headers (New → Neu, Working → In Bearbeitung, Qualified → Qualifiziert, Trial Scheduled → Probebehandlung geplant)
   - Buttons and UI elements
   - Status badges and tooltips
   - Modal dialogs and forms

## Phase 2: Archive & History Functionality  
4. **Rename "Archive History" to "Archiv"** in archive panel
5. **Make Archive always visible** (remove toggle functionality, permanent display)
6. **Add View Toggle**: Create switcher between "Kanban" and "Verlauf" (History) views
7. **Implement "Verlauf" history view**:
   - Show chronological list of all lead actions (moved/restored/converted)
   - Include timestamps, user actions, status changes
   - Filter and search capabilities
   - Export functionality
   - **DECISION NEEDED**: Time limitation (recent month/year vs unlimited)

## Phase 3: Enhanced Kanban Behavior
8. **Bottom placement for moved leads**: Modify drag & drop logic to add leads to bottom of target column instead of top
9. **Visual drop zone indication**: Highlight/lighten the future drop position during drag operations
10. **Prevent same-column drops**: Cancel drag action if trying to drop lead in the same column it's already in
11. **Investigate sidebar disappearing issue**: Debug and fix sidebar visibility problem specifically in leads tab

## Phase 4: User Experience Improvements
12. **German error messages and notifications**
13. **Improved mobile responsiveness for new layout**
14. **Enhanced keyboard navigation support**
15. **Better loading states and transitions**
16. **Consistent German terminology throughout**

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Modify:
- `frontend/public/src/app.js` (sidebar navigation, line 8041)
- `frontend/public/src/components/studio/LeadKanban.js` (main component)
- `backend/src/controllers/leadKanbanController.js` (if API changes needed for history)
- `backend/src/routes/leadKanban.js` (if new endpoints needed)

### Key Code Locations:
- **Sidebar navigation**: `app.js:8041` - `{ icon: 'fas fa-user-plus', text: 'Lead Listen', section: 'leads' }`
- **Search bar**: `LeadKanban.js:162-173` - Search input group in render method
- **Archive panel**: `LeadKanban.js:337-457` - renderArchivePanel method
- **Drag & drop**: `LeadKanban.js:825-852` - handleDrop method
- **German translations needed**: Throughout LeadKanban.js render methods

### Database Considerations for History:
- May need new table for lead action history
- Consider indexing for performance on large datasets
- Implement proper pagination for history view

## Questions for User Decision:

### History Time Limitation
Should the "Verlauf" (history) view show:
- **Option A**: Recent activity only (last month/3 months/year)
- **Option B**: Unlimited history (all actions ever taken)  
- **Option C**: Configurable time range with user selection

**Impact**: This affects database performance, storage requirements, and UI complexity.

### Additional Features
1. Should history include lead import events from Google Sheets?
2. Do you want export functionality for history data?
3. Should there be role-based permissions for viewing history?

## Risk Assessment:
- **Low risk**: UI text changes and basic German translations
- **Medium complexity**: New history view implementation and kanban behavior changes
- **High value**: Improved German UX and better workflow efficiency
- **Potential issues**: Database performance with unlimited history, mobile layout with always-visible archive

## Success Criteria:
1. ✅ Tab renamed to "Leads" in German interface
2. ✅ Search bar removed from above kanban
3. ✅ Archive always visible and renamed to "Archiv"
4. ✅ View toggle between Kanban and Verlauf working
5. ✅ Leads added to bottom of columns when moved
6. ✅ Visual indicators during drag operations
7. ✅ Same-column drops prevented
8. ✅ Sidebar visibility issue resolved
9. ✅ All German translations implemented consistently

## Next Steps:
1. Get user decision on history time limitation
2. Implement Phase 1 (basic updates)
3. Test and iterate on Phase 2 (archive/history)
4. Implement Phase 3 (enhanced kanban)
5. Polish with Phase 4 (UX improvements)
