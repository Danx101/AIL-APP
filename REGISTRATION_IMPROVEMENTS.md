# Registration & Session Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 500 Error on Registration
**Problem**: Email verification fails but user is created in database  
**Solution**: 
- Added proper email service initialization checks
- Added transaction rollback if email sending fails
- Improved error messages with specific error codes

### 2. Duplicate Email Problem
**Problem**: Users can't re-register if email wasn't verified  
**Solution**:
- Modified registration to detect unverified users
- Added helpful error message with resend option
- Added verification attempts tracking

### 3. Premature Session Timeout
**Problem**: "Sitzung ist abgelaufen" appears too quickly on login page  
**Solution**:
- Removed token validation on app initialization
- Only validate tokens when making authenticated requests
- Added `validateTokenIfNeeded()` method for explicit validation

### 4. No Resend Email Feature
**Problem**: Users can't request verification email again  
**Solution**:
- Added new `/api/v1/auth/resend-verification` endpoint
- Frontend resend button with rate limiting (max 5 attempts)
- Better error handling for email service failures

### 5. Unverified User Cleanup
**Problem**: Abandoned registrations clutter database  
**Solution**:
- Added scheduled job to delete unverified users after 7 days
- Cleanup runs daily at 2 AM
- Audit logging for cleanup actions
