## Manager Authorization System ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

> before creating a code for the new studio owner, i want to be able to specify what city the studio is allocated in and the owner name for the overview and also that after activation of the account this info is already filled in for the owner

**Implementation Notes (July 18, 2025):**
- ✅ Created `manager_codes` table with fields: `intended_owner_name`, `intended_city`, `intended_studio_name`
- ✅ Updated authentication controller to require manager codes for studio owner registration
- ✅ Pre-fills user profile with intended owner name during registration
- ✅ Added studio creation pre-fill endpoint that uses manager code information
- ✅ Studio creation now automatically uses city and studio name from manager code
- ✅ Created manager controller with code generation and oversight features
- ✅ Added manager routes for code management and statistics
- ✅ **NEW:** Complete frontend implementation with three-tier user interface
- ✅ **NEW:** Manager dashboard with code generation interface
- ✅ **NEW:** Studio owner registration with manager code validation
- ✅ **NEW:** Studio setup with pre-fill functionality
- ✅ **NEW:** Customer registration flow with activation codes
- ✅ **NEW:** Navigation improvements (logout, brand links, back buttons)
- ✅ **NEW:** Business rules enforced (studio owners generate 1 code, 3-day expiry)

**Available API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/manager/studio-owner-codes` - Generate codes with city/owner info
- `GET /api/v1/manager/studio-owner-codes` - View generated codes
- `GET /api/v1/manager/stats` - Manager statistics
- `GET /api/v1/manager/studios` - Overview of all studios
- `GET /api/v1/manager/cities` - Cities overview
- `GET /api/v1/studios/prefill-info` - Get pre-fill info for studio creation
- `POST /api/v1/studios/:id/activation-codes` - Generate activation codes (1 code, 3-day expiry)
- `GET /api/v1/studios/:id/activation-codes` - View studio activation codes

**User Flow:**
1. **Manager**: Creates code with owner name, city, and optional studio name
2. **Studio Owner**: Registers with manager code → profile auto-filled with owner name
3. **Studio Owner**: Creates studio → city and studio name auto-filled from manager code
4. **Studio Owner**: Generates activation codes for customers (1 code, 3-day expiry)
5. **Customer**: Registers with activation code → access to studio services

This creates a secure three-tier authorization system: Manager → Studio Owner → Customer 

## Navigation & UX Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

> perfect! i could access the studio dashboard! hower once i entered studio setup again i could not return back to dashboard. Also i would like to be able logout to return to the main page.
