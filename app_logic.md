## Manager Authorization System ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

> before creating a code for the new studio owner, i want to be able to specify what city the studio is allocated in and the owner name for the overview and also that after activation of the account this info is already filled in for the owner

**Implementation Notes (July 18, 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Created `manager_codes` table with fields: `intended_owner_name`, `intended_city`, `intended_studio_name`
- ‚úÖ Updated authentication controller to require manager codes for studio owner registration
- ‚úÖ Pre-fills user profile with intended owner name during registration
- ‚úÖ Added studio creation pre-fill endpoint that uses manager code information
- ‚úÖ Studio creation now automatically uses city and studio name from manager code
- ‚úÖ Created manager controller with code generation and oversight features
- ‚úÖ Added manager routes for code management and statistics
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Complete frontend implementation with three-tier user interface
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Manager dashboard with code generation interface
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Studio owner registration with manager code validation
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Studio setup with pre-fill functionality
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Customer registration flow with activation codes
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Navigation improvements (logout, brand links, back buttons)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Business rules enforced (studio owners generate 1 code, 3-day expiry)

**Available API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/manager/studio-owner-codes` - Generate codes with city/owner info
- `GET /api/v1/manager/studio-owner-codes` - View generated codes
- `GET /api/v1/manager/stats` - Manager statistics
- `GET /api/v1/manager/studios` - Overview of all studios
- `GET /api/v1/manager/cities` - Cities overview
- `GET /api/v1/studios/prefill-info` - Get pre-fill info for studio creation
- `POST /api/v1/studios/:id/activation-codes` - Generate activation codes (1 code, 3-day expiry)
- `GET /api/v1/studios/:id/activation-codes` - View studio activation codes

**User Flow:**
1. **Manager**: Creates code with owner name, city, and optional studio name
2. **Studio Owner**: Registers with manager code ‚Üí profile auto-filled with owner name
3. **Studio Owner**: Creates studio ‚Üí city and studio name auto-filled from manager code
4. **Studio Owner**: Generates activation codes for customers (1 code, 3-day expiry)
5. **Customer**: Registers with activation code ‚Üí access to studio services

This creates a secure three-tier authorization system: Manager ‚Üí Studio Owner ‚Üí Customer 

## Navigation & UX Improvements ‚úÖ COMPLETED

> perfect! i could access the studio dashboard! hower once i entered studio setup again i could not return back to dashboard. Also i would like to be able logout to return to the main page.

## Phase 3: Sprint 3.3 - Customer Interface & Enhanced Features

### Current Issues to Address (July 19, 2025)

#### üî• HIGH PRIORITY BUGS
1. **403 Forbidden Errors for Customer "Anna Kunde"**
   - Customer authentication failing
   - Cannot access appointment endpoints
   - Timeline/calendar not loading for customers

2. **Studio Timeline Display Issues**
   - Customer names showing as "undefined undefined"
   - Missing customer information in appointment blocks

#### üì± UI/UX Improvements
3. **Customer Timeline Layout**
   - Make timeline view broader than calendar for customers
   - Improve visual balance and usability

#### üéØ Business Logic Enhancements
4. **Automatic Appointment Status Management**

   - Past "best√§tigt" appointments ‚Üí automatically "abgeschlossen" (completed)
   - Allow studio owners to change status to "abgesagt" or "nicht erschienen"

### üí≥ NEW FEATURE: Session/Block Package System

#### Concept Overview
Customers purchase session packages (10x or 20x treatments) directly in studio. Both customer and studio owner need visibility into remaining sessions.

#### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Customer session packages
CREATE TABLE customer_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    studio_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total_sessions INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 10 or 20
    remaining_sessions INTEGER NOT NULL,
    purchase_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (studio_id) REFERENCES studios(id)
);

-- Session transaction log
CREATE TABLE session_transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    customer_session_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'purchase', 'deduction', 'topup', 'refund'
    amount INTEGER NOT NULL, -- positive for add, negative for deduct
    appointment_id INTEGER, -- if related to appointment
    created_by_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_session_id) REFERENCES customer_sessions(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (appointment_id) REFERENCES appointments(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by_user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

#### Business Rules
1. **Session Purchase/Top-up (Studio Owner Only)**
   - Can add +10 or +20 sessions for any customer
   - Creates audit trail in transactions table
   - Updates customer's remaining session count

2. **Session Consumption**
   - Only "abgeschlossen" (completed) appointments consume sessions
   - Automatic deduction when past appointments marked complete
   - Cannot book if 0 sessions remaining

3. **Session Display**
   - **Customer View**: Prominent session counter, booking restrictions
   - **Studio Owner View**: Session count per customer, top-up controls

#### API Endpoints to Implement
```
GET /api/v1/customers/me/sessions - Customer's session info
GET /api/v1/customers/:id/sessions - Studio owner view customer sessions
POST /api/v1/customers/:id/sessions/topup - Add sessions (+10/+20)
GET /api/v1/sessions/transactions/:sessionId - Transaction history
PATCH /api/v1/appointments/:id/complete - Complete appointment (deduct session)
```

#### Frontend Components to Add
1. **Customer Dashboard**
   - Session counter widget (prominent display)
   - Low session warning (< 3 remaining)
   - Session history view

2. **Studio Owner Interface**
   - Customer list with session counts
   - Session top-up buttons (+10, +20)
   - Session transaction history per customer

#### Session Logic Flow
1. **Initial Setup**: Studio owner creates session package for new customer
2. **Appointment Booking**: Check remaining sessions before allowing booking
3. **Appointment Completion**: Auto-deduct session when appointment marked "abgeschlossen"
4. **Session Top-up**: Studio owner can add more sessions anytime
5. **Session Tracking**: Full audit trail of all session movements

### Implementation Priority
1. ‚úÖ Fix 403 authentication errors
2. ‚úÖ Fix timeline customer name display
3. ‚úÖ Improve customer timeline layout
4. ‚úÖ Implement automatic appointment status logic
5. ‚úÖ Design and implement session/block system database
6. ‚úÖ Create session management API endpoints
7. ‚è≥ Build session UI components for customer dashboard
8. ‚è≥ Build session management UI for studio owners
9. ‚úÖ Implement session consumption logic with appointments
10. ‚úÖ Add session transaction history and reporting

### Success Criteria
